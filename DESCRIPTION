Description: Defines an S4 class for storing data from spatially resolved 
    transcriptomics (ST) experiments. The class extends SingleCellExperiment to 
    support storage and retrieval of additional information from spot-based and 
    molecule-based ST platforms, including spatial coordinates, images, and 
    image metadata. A specialized constructor function is included for data 
    from the 10x Genomics Visium platform.
